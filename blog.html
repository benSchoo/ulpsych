            OMG, the coolest lecture today - Dr. K talked about how they‚Äôre using neuroscience to boost memory with sound waves! Basically, they play different tones in each ear, and your brain syncs up to strengthen memories. It‚Äôs like hacking your brain to remember stuff without even trying!
            <br><br>
            All I would have to do is listen to a short audio clip and I would drastically improve my memory??? I would never have to study again! Well, actually, I think you have to listen to the audio file multiple times. The more you listen the better the memory consolidation ‚Äì according to Dr. K.
            <br><br>
            But THEN, right in the middle of the lecture, Dr. O‚Äôbanion walks in, and I swear I‚Äôve never seen him look so stressed. He pulls Dr. K aside, and they start whisper-arguing about how it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot ready‚Äù to be talked about yet. Dr. K looked kinda freaked out after and ended class early. And now I can‚Äôt stop thinking‚Ä¶ what if this actually works? Imagine never forgetting anything again. ü§Ø<a href="https://view.genially.com/67dc30e654435924aaf02a9c/interactive-content-online-crossword-puzzle">Quite Puzzling...</a>

            Is anyone else seriously losing it this semester?! Not to brag, but I‚Äôm usually an A1 student‚Ä¶ and I just got a C2 on my last paper. A C2!! I was fuming. I‚Äôve always done well in Dr. K‚Äôs class, so I figured I‚Äôd stay after the lecture to see what went wrong. But OF COURSE, he was busy listening to other students whining about their grades. Like, maybe if you didn‚Äôt go out every night, your grades wouldn‚Äôt be shite! üôÑ
            <br><br>
            I was just standing there like an absolute lemon, waiting to talk to Dr. K, when - boom - he absolutely lost it on me. I swear, one second, I was just glancing around his desk, and the next, he was roaring about ‚Äúconfidential files‚Äù and calling me intrusive. I legit almost cried right then and there. I bolted out of that room so fast, but I was shaking the whole way out. Tried to go back and apologize after like 10 minutes, but Dr. O‚Äôbanion was there. Dr. K handed him some files and told him to get rid of it. No way I was risking another lecture, so I just left. Ughhh, I really hope this doesn‚Äôt affect my grade!! <a href="https://view.genially.com/67ed7dc9bd8900fcdc7871f9/interactive-content-online-memory-mishap-letter-2">Memory Mishap</a>

            Okay, maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic, but I genuinely can‚Äôt think of a single good memory from this semester. It‚Äôs just been pure chaos. I‚Äôm literally in the library right now, procrastinating instead of finishing this stupid Cognitive Psych paper. I have way too much work to do, but honestly? I‚Äôm so over lectures. People are acting weird, and I cannot deal with it anymore.
            <br><br>
            The stress from exams is one thing, but things have gotten so out of hand. Every lecture is a mess - someone‚Äôs always crying about needing an extension because they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt remember anything,‚Äù others are freaking out about friends who haven‚Äôt shown up in weeks, and now lecturers are barely even showing up themselves. Am I the only one noticing how bizarre this is??
            <br><br>
            I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it. But something about this whole semester feels off

            Funniest moment of the semester, hands down - Dr.K‚Äôs class when Shane walked in a solid half-hour late.
            <br><br>
            He looked so lost, like he‚Äôd just woken up in a different dimension. He did this slow, confused walk to the back of the room, eyes darting around like he had no idea where he was. I figured he was just massively hungover since he didn‚Äôt show up to football training the night before
            <br><br>
            Then Dr. K starts going on about some weird phrase - aqua lethe or something - and Shane just stares at him, absolutely baffled. Like, full-on squinting, trying to figure out if he missed something important or if Dr. K had just lost the plot. I was dying trying not to laugh.
            Meant to check in with him after class, but I got distracted. Figured I‚Äôd see him at football, but weirdly, he never showed up again for the rest of the semester. Still, that moment lives rent-free in my head - Shane looking like he‚Äôd wandered into the wrong universe hahahah<a href="https://view.genially.com/67ebafabf3c47e365531e010/interactive-content-online-forgotten-puzzles-lette4-online">Forgotten Puzzles</a>

            Lately, I‚Äôve been forgetting things ‚Äì like real gaps in my memory. People on campus talk to me like they know me, but I don‚Äôt recognize them. I don‚Äôt remember going to my classes, even though I have notes in my handwriting. It‚Äôs freaking me out!!!<br><br>
            I talked to Dr. K, since I‚Äôm helping him with a memory study, but he just said it‚Äôs probably stress. But there‚Äôs something else.<br><br>
            It‚Äôs not just forgetting ‚Äì I‚Äôm also remembering things that haven‚Äôt happened yet.<br><br>
            I know it sounds insane, but these memories feel real, like I‚Äôve already lived through them. They‚Äôre so specific. I started writing them down, hoping if they come true, I can figure out what‚Äôs going on.<br><br>
            But I‚Äôm not even worried if they‚Äôre right ‚Äì I‚Äôm scared of them being wrong. What would that mean?<br><br>

          Took a spontaneous walk around campus this afternoon. <br>
          Ended up exploring some forgotten corners and discovering cool, hidden details. <br>
          Sometimes, the best moments are unplanned.

          Wrapped up the day with a stroll by the lake. <br>
          The cool breeze and calm water gave me time to reflect on the chaos of campus life. <br>
          Sometimes, you just need a quiet moment to recharge.

          Today was one of those unexpected days. <br>
          Missed my morning bus and ended up having an impromptu chat with a professor about some wild memory theories. <br>
          College life really keeps you on your toes!

          Ended up late at night revisiting old lecture halls. <br>
          It‚Äôs like walking through memories‚Äîboth strange and familiar.

          Woke up feeling a bit out of it today. <br>
          My memory‚Äôs been playing tricks again, and I can‚Äôt seem to shake this foggy feeling. <br>
          Hoping a strong coffee and a good laugh will set me straight.

          Spent the afternoon retracing my steps around campus. <br>
          I was determined not to let my memory gaps win. Walked from the library to the quad and back again. <br>
          It was exhausting, but oddly therapeutic.
